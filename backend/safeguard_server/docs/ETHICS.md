- Alerting parents to protect child

❌ **Inappropriate:**
- Reading every message

## 💡 Best Practices for Ethical Use

### The "Trust and Verify" Approach

1. **Start with Communication:**
   ```
   Week 1: Talk about internet safety (no monitoring yet)
   Week 2: Explain the system, install together
   Week 3: Review first blocked attempts together
   Week 4+: Regular check-ins, focus on education
   ```

2. **Gradual Reduction:**
   ```
   Ages 10-12: Active monitoring and frequent discussions
   Ages 13-15: Reduce frequency, focus on patterns only
   Ages 16-17: Minimal monitoring, mostly trust-based
   Ages 18+:   Remove completely (adult privacy)
   ```

3. **Positive Reinforcement:**
   - Acknowledge responsible behavior
   - Gradually increase trust
   - Reward maturity with privacy
   - Celebrate good judgment

### Sample Conversation Scripts

#### Initial Installation:
```
Parent: "Hey [child], I want to talk about internet safety. There's a lot
        of content online that isn't appropriate for your age. I'm going
        to install a safety system that blocks harmful websites. You'll
        know when a site is blocked, and I'll get a notification. This
        isn't to spy on you - I won't see everything you browse, just if
        something harmful is blocked. Can we talk about this?"
```

#### After a Blocked Site:
```
Parent: "I got a notification that a website was blocked today. I'm not
        mad - curiosity is normal. But let's talk about why that content
        isn't appropriate right now. Do you have questions?"
```

#### Requesting Unblock:
```
Child:  "The filter blocked a site I need for homework."
Parent: "Let's look at it together. If it's legitimate, I can add it to
        the allowed list. That's why we review these together."
```

monitoring system because you've earned that trust and privacy."
```
